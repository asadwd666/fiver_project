        <p style="font-size: .8rem; color: black;"><b>What is a browser?</b><br>A web browser is a software program that allows a user to locate, access, and display web pages.  The most common browsers are Chrome by Google, Edge by Microsoft, Safari by Apple, and Firefox by Mozilla.</p>
        <p style="font-size: .8rem; color: black;"><b>Why can&apos;t I view this site on Internet Explorer?</b><br>Microsoft discontinued Internet Explorer in January of 2016 and replaced it with Edge. The most recent version (Internet Explorer 11) lacks adoption of many HTML5 and CSS web standards. Features coded into CondoSites <i>do</i> utilize these modern standards and we plan to use more of them. So to make sure everyone has the same excellent experience, and to offer better functionality in the future, we have adopted certain minimum browser requirements.</p>
        <p style="font-size: .8rem; color: black;"><b>But everyone uses Internet Explorer?</b><br>Not true anymore.  While Internet Explorer once had 90% market share, today it has less than 3%. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> - January 22, 2019)</p>
        <p style="font-size: .8rem; color: black;"><b>What should I do?</b><br>In order to use this site, and many others, you need to upgrade your browser to either <a href="https://chrome.com/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge</a>, <a href="https://apple.com/safari" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a>, or <a href="https://firefox.com/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>.  All are free to download and use.</p>
        <p style="font-size: .8rem; color: black;"><b>Which browser is best?</b><br>Each browser is a little different, so the choice is up to you.  The most commonly used browser for our software is Google Chrome, and we develop our platform on Mozilla Firefox.</p>
